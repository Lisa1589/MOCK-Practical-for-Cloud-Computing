Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet. 
These services are divided into three main categories:
i)Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
ii)Platform as a Service (PaaS)
iii)Software as a Service (SaaS)
A cloud can be private or public. A public cloud sells services to anyone on the internet. A private cloud is a proprietary network or a data center that supplies hosted 
services to a limited number of people, with certain access and permissions settings. Private or public, the goal of cloud computing is to provide easy, scalable access 
to computing resources and IT services.
Examples of cloud computing include:

Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365: Users can access Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365 through the internet.
Users can be more productive because they can access work presentations and spreadsheets stored in the cloud at any time from anywhere on any device.
Email, Calendar, Skype, WhatsApp: Emails, calendars, Skype and WhatsApp take advantage of the cloud's ability to provide users with access to data remotely so they can access
their personal data on any device, whenever and wherever they want.
Zoom: Zoom is a cloud-based software platform for video and audio conferencing that records meetings and saves them to the cloud, enabling users to access them anywhere and at
any time.
AWS Lambda: Lambda allows developers to run code for applications or back-end services without having to provision or manage servers. 
The pay-as-you-go model constantly scales with an organization to accommodate real-time changes in data usage and data storage
